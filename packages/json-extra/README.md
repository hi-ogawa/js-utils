# json-extra

Simple and trivial alternative for
[`@brillout/json-serializer`](https://github.com/brillout/json-serializer/),
[`superjson`](https://github.com/blitz-js/superjson), etc...

Core ideas are based on `@brillout/json-serializer`
but it employs an array-based encoding for special values,
which makes easy to [support custom types](https://github.com/brillout/json-serializer/issues/3)
and also provides human-readibility for custom containers.

## examples

```tsx
// TODO
```
